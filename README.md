Introduction:
-------------

The aim of the project was to select a hobby in which we can use CRUD functionality by connecting the back-end to the front-end by applying the content taught to us during the training. 

Project Management - Jira was used to manage the project with various user stories and tasks with the correct format, acceptance criteria, user story points and MosCow prioritisation. There was also some Jira-GitHub Integration.

Version Control - GitHub and Git was used to commit and use the feature branch models and creating pull requests to close the branches and finally merge into main.

Databases - A relational database was used to store the contents of the project generated from the frontend by using the backend.

Back-End - Springboot project was created and followed the OOP principles.

Testing - 97.9% test coverage by using integration testing MockMVC.

Front-End Development - Front-end website created by using html,css and javascript. Bootstrap was used as the main source of design.

### Planning Resources:

First I will be talking about project management - Jira was used to create a Kanban board where user stories was allocated to its own epics and tasks. Some of the user stories was blocked until the stories had been completed. There was story point estimates included and MosCow prioritisation to assess which tasks and user stories are more urgent than others. The user stories also had acceptance criteria for situations where the condition has been met. The use of Jira-GitHub integeration will also be included in the example below:

Below is how my current sprint looks with to-do, ongoing and completed user-stories and tasks. The roadmap shows the progress and timeframe of the current sprint.
